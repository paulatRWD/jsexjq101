            <section>

                <p>
                    This exercise requires you to complete the CSS and JavaScript logic necessary to implement a 'modal window' component (otherwise known as a popup window). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window" target="_blank">Wikipedia description of a modal window</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The modal window will be opened via either a link ('a' tag) or button ('button' tag). In order for your logic to identify one of these modal trigger elements, a CSS class must be applied to it 'modal-link'. In addition, to associate a trigger with a particular modal container (explained soon), the same modal trigger element must have a 'data-modal-target' attribute defined on it. The value of this attribute will be the id of the modal container. An example modal trigger is provided below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="#" class="modal-link" data-modal-target="modal1Target"> <!--ADD onclick here-->
                        Click me, I'm a modal trigger
                    </a>
                </p>
								<p>
                    A modal container is what becomes visible when the modal trigger is clicked. It must have the CSS class 'modal-container'. If you look in the styles.css file, you'll notice that the 'modal-container' class is invisible by default (display: none;), in order to make it visible when the modal trigger element is clicked you will need to add the 'active' CSS class to it. An example has been provided in the HTML markup with the ID 'modal1Target'
                </p>

                <h3>INTERMEDIATE level</h3>

                <p>
                    So with this in mind, you must do the following:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Find all elements in the HTML with a CSS class of 'modal-link'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apply to these elements an 'onclick' event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complete the necessary logic in the click event:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Get a reference to the clicked element from the 'click' event object which is accessible in the event as a parameter.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Get the ID provided in the value of the elements 'data-modal-target' attribute.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Find the target modal container on page using the ID which we just retreived.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the 'active' CSS class to this modal container element.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now, you will have to enable the functionality to then HIDE this modal container. This logic is almost the same as the logic to open the modal but instead applied to the elements with the class name 'modal-close-btn'. The one difference is finding the modal container associated with the close button. In place of the 'data' attribute used in the open link logic, use instead this method: elem.closest('.modal-container'). This method finds the closest parent element with that CSS class name, and since our close button is inside the container, this works!<br />

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You must also complete the styling so that the visible modal looks like the image below.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <img src="images/result.PNG" alt="Result" width="400px" />

                <h3>EXPERT level</h3>

                <p>
                    Now implement the same logic but using JQuery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Duplicate the index.html and scripts.js files and rename: jqindex.html and jqscripts.js. Make sure you update the reference to the script file in jqindex.html!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Proceed to read through the JQuery documentation. Keep in mind that JQuery is an extension of JavaScript, so everything you've done in your JavaScript exercise will be achievable in JQuery. That said, here's some links to get you started...
